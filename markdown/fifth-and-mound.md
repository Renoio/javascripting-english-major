## 5th & Mound

5th & Mound is an intersection in Cincinnati that doesn’t exist anymore. It was
destroyed to make way for Interstate 75. Nevertheless, 5th & Mound had been part
of Cincinnati’s Kenyon-Barr neighborhood, which was part of the [West
End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End,_Cincinnati), which remains the most
African-American area in the city. Not much is available about this neighborhood
online, but the Cincinnati History Library and Archives provides a [search
tool](http://library.cincymuseum.org/starweb/photos/servlet.starweb?path=photos/photo-session.web)
that lets the user browse their Kenyon Barr Collection, which features a series
of creepy photos of the neighborhood, taken as the city was preparing to raze it
to the ground. As *Cincinnati Magazine* notes, [25,737 people lived in
Kenyon-Barr](http://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/citywiseblog/lost-city-kenyon-barr-queensgate/)
when the city demolished it.
