          <p>It was a great privilege to be able to teach this course as part of my
“<a href="https://muziejus.github.io/novel-maps-of-ny-2017/">Novel Maps of New York</a>”
course at NYU in 2017. I got a lot of feedback from my students, and that,
coupled with my own extended thinking about inclusivity in programming
pedagogy, has directed how this course should proceed. I’ve also used this
course as a resource for teaching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iepGc3prnEA">quick workshop on
JavaScript</a> for
<a href="http://nycdh.org">NYCDH</a>, and I’ve used parts of it in my 2018 course,
“<a href="https://muziejus.github.io/media-history-of-nyc/">Media History of New
York</a>.”</p>

<p>Below are some thoughts about how to improve this website and the underlying
course. I don’t expect this to be a completed document, and I will add to it
as I prepare the upgrade (probably this summer), but I also think it may be of
use to others.</p>

<p>There are two paths to improving <em>The JavaScripting English Major</em>, and
they may seem initially unrelated. First, there’s the question of how to
improve the choices I make in terms of the technologies taught. Second,
however, are the pedagogical choices I make in terms of aligning the course
better with its implicit and explicit goals. But the paths are, in fact, tightly
related. Pursuing inclusivity, for example, requires changes in both aspects
of the course, as what might seem like “just” a technical choice can be,
actually, anti-inclusionary.</p>

<p>Since this website is designed both to guide my teaching of the course and to
inspire others to learn JavaScript (or use it in their own teaching!), I
<em>must</em> aim to keep pedagogical concerns transparent. It may seem weird for me
to talk about “requiring weekly labs,” say, as part of what version 2 of
this course’s <em>website</em> would look like, especially without providing detailed
lesson plans for those labs. But the weekly labs build on and reinforce what
this site already provides, and the site can be improved to make those labs
even more useful. Not every student will need them, of course, and not every
instructor can afford to provide them. But it strikes me that the labs, like
all the changes proposed below, should be goals to which we (teachers) aspire.</p>

<section id="background">
  <h2 id="s-background">Background</h2>

  <p>My 12-student class in the fall had only one student with programming
experience. Similarly, the course was demographically not a stereotypical
programming course, by which I mean that, like most of the courses I teach,
white men were a distinct minority.The students almost universally said that
they chose the course because it seemed interesting and they needed some kind
of writing course for their major. The plurality were
pre-med/bio.<sup id="fnref:english-major"><a href="#fn:english-major" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  <p><em>The JavaScripting English Major</em>, as the title suggests, is already aimed at
a “non-traditional” computer science audience: humanities undergraduates.
Nevertheless, in teaching the course, I quickly understood that I was falling
into some anti-inclusive traps. And getting rid of those traps, that are both
pedagogical and technical, underscore how this project is to continue.</p>

</section>
<section id="inclusivity">
  <h2 id="s-inclusivity">Inclusivity</h2>

  <p>As mentioned above, the whole point of <em>The JavaScripting English Major</em> is to
be more inclusive than the JavaScript textbooks that I considered using.
Programming books, in my experience, <a href="/v1/0-introduction#not-english-major">are written for CS
students</a>, meaning they highlight concepts
that are obscure or irrelevant to humanities students who want to learn
JavaScript. The books can be great, but their audience is wrong.</p>

  <p>That CS has an inclusivity problem is no surprise. Nevertheless, a lot of the
suggestions someone like <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-talk/making-computer-science-more-inclusive">Ashe Dryden can make to Stanford’s CS
department</a>
demonstrate potential means by which programming can be made more inclusive
even to non-CS majors. A lot of the tips Dryden gives I was already using in
the design of this course, but some I had overlooked.</p>

  <h2 id="s-things-to-change-pedagogy-edition">Things to change: Pedagogy edition</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>No ninja programming:</strong> Edge cases are great, but I should not be
asking students to explain to me why, in their second homework
assignment, <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.1 + 0.2</code> returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.30000000000000004</code>. The instructor
should know the answer, of course, but asking students to figure it out is
precisely the sort of arrogant, exclusionary type of assignment to scare
away students. None of my students got this problem correct, and one even
suggested that it’s because “computers are more precise,” which is
precisely the <em>opposite</em> take-home message of such an assignment.</p>

      <p>In fact, in trying to explain this problem in class, I went down a massive
rabbit hole once it was clear that my students (or so they claimed) had
never been taught how to calculate in binary. It was fun for me to teach,
and it was maybe fun for the students, but it certainly didn’t make any of
them feel like they understood JavaScript better.</p>

      <p>“No ninja programming” is also an encouragement to use clunky, over-literal
syntax as well. Define variables and then assign them separately, for
example.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Use Atom in class:</strong> I’ve already made this change for this semester. I
don’t use Atom in my day-to-day, but I also think it’s great for students,
because it has a ton of great features built-in and a (comparably) flat
learning curve. Hence, this course is designed, in part, around it. Nevertheless, when I was leading discussion of homework in
class, I would be doing all my coding on the projected screen in Vim. Students
noticed the difference, and one even suggested she felt like I was
patronizing by teaching the “toy” Atom program instead of the “real”
program I use.</p>

      <p>More importantly, students had <em>far</em> more technical trouble with Atom than I
imagined they would. I’ve already addressed this in part by starting an
<a href="help/atom">Atom Help</a> page that tackles the most common stumbling blocks
my students encounter. But the fact that they couldn’t see <em>me</em> use Atom in class makes the software even more obscure, I suspect. Seeing my clicks, etc., provides visual cues for how Atom works that they can rely on later.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Have a weekly lab where students bring their laptops:</strong> My <em>students</em>
recommended this one to me. They <em>asked</em> for more class! I generally don’t
let my students use their laptops in class, but they were also having
serious technical issues I could not predict. As a result, they had to rely
on being free during my office hours or free for a few minutes before and
after class to ask for specific, technical help. That, in my opinion, is bad
pedagogy.</p>

      <p>If a student has an internship/job/busy schedule and can only do the
homework at midnight, and all of a sudden Atom is doing weird things,
they’ll probably get frustrated and resent the class/professor for
requiring such a dumb piece of software. And they have no recourse.
Assuming they’re like me—and that they’d just go to Stack Overflow—is
<em>anti-inclusionary</em> and, again, <em>bad pedagogy</em>.</p>

      <p>This semester, I had all the students install Atom and make their first
commits to our shared GitHub blog in class, at the same time. And wow. I
had not anticipated the myriad ways they would find what I thought were
crystal clear instructions rather opaque. This was a great experience.</p>

      <p>It makes perfect sense, then, to have students work on homework together in
a weekly lab, leaving “regular” class for discussion of the readings, etc. At the lab, I can reiterate concepts from
regular class, find new hiccups that I haven’t anticipated, and catch
students who are slipping behind. Speaking of…</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Mentor better and monitor students’ progress better:</strong> My approach to the
homework assignments in <em>The JavaScripting English Major</em> didn’t work
right. I had students put in a good faith effort at each problem set and
push it to their own repository. I’d look those over before class and, in
class, I’d ask if students had questions and go over the problems in class, with extra attention paid to where students ran into trouble in their posted homework.
That was <em>insufficient</em>, because it relied on the <em>unearned</em> assumption
that all of the students were caught up and doing the homework in the first place…</p>

      <p>Dealing with non- and under-performing students is a particular concern of
mine, because “under-performing” is a brilliant description of me as a
student. I liked that professors kept their nose out of my business,
but I also resented them for not reaching out to me to help me when I was
particularly adrift. As a teacher, I’m in a similar position now, where
part of me takes the “they’re adults” line, but I’m starting to think
that’s not the right approach. That is, if it breaks my heart to fail a student, then the solution shouldn’t be “well, some students fail.” The
solution should be “make it so students don’t fail.”</p>

      <p>I should be more attuned to how
alienating programming work can be to humanities students, meaning I should
not simply dump all of the responsibility of trying to get caught up on the
student. If I know a student is woefully behind in their homework—and in
this course, the homework is cumulative and falling behind is a recipe for
disaster—then I should be far more concerned at catching them up than I
have been.<sup id="fnref:underperformance"><a href="#fn:underperformance" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Given the marked correlation between
students’ keeping up with the homework and their grades on their final
projects (to say nothing of their final grades), a weekly lab should also
help here with improving outcomes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Require journaling:</strong> This may grow in importance as I think more and
more in terms of self-evaluation and
“<a href="http://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/">ungrading</a>,” but having the
students reflect on their difficulties and feel open to critiquing how
things are going during the course of the semester would be a good move. My
students’ suggestions at the end of the semester were great—but I could
have “easily” implemented some of them at midterm and some students’
performance would’ve improved alongside.</p>
    </li>

<section id="technology-to-change">
  <h2 id="s-things-to-change-technology-edition">Things to change: Technology edition</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Provide more materials:</strong> By this I mean documents like my
<a href="/v1/help/js-cheat-sheet">JavaScript cheat sheet</a>. In teaching JavaScript, I
settled into some mantras (“what do all objects have?” “properties!”), but
this cheat sheet was maybe too little, too late.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Use the console less:</strong> Students are learning JavaScript to learn how to
(mostly) make webpages. I should get them out of the console as quickly as
possible, then. This could even mean flipping the order of some chapters,
like teaching students how to have elements appear on the page before they
have used JS as a calculator.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Use the console more:</strong> On the other hand, my students were helpless at
doing their own troubleshooting, and they didn’t know to use the console
to help solve their various problems. The <a href="/v1/7-errors">chapter on errors</a> is
meant to be a bit of a midterm break for the students, but that’s probably
wrong. This could be its own help page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Solve the variable definition problem:</strong> Throughout, I encourage students
to define their variables first and only later assign them. This works fine
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">var</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>, but it does <em>not</em> work with <code class="highlighter-rouge">const</code>. Nevertheless,
the consensus seems to be growing that <a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/use-const-and-make-your-javascript-code-better-aac4f3786ca1">we should be using <code class="highlighter-rouge">const</code> as our
“default” variable
definer</a>,
especially considering that variables defined with <code class="highlighter-rouge">const</code> maintain their
mutability, something I assumed not to be the case.</p>

      <p>I can get away with only using <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>, but if I introduce <code class="highlighter-rouge">const</code>, then I
<em>must</em> also introduce <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>, which might be unnecessarily complex.</p>
    </li>
   <li>

      <p><strong>Get rid of jQuery:</strong> As they say, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/now-ever-might-not-need-jquery/">now, more than ever, you might not need jQuery</a>. 
        What to me appear as obvious wins in terms of readability might not be as clear to students. <code class="highlighter-rouge">document.querySelectorAll()</code> 
        is “more verbose” than <code class="highlighter-rouge">$()</code>, but at least it explains itself. This would also go into thinking about a chapter about the DOM.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Move students into an html sandbox:</strong> I already do this for my <a href="http://talks.moacir.com/simple-javascript-mapping/#/9">Simple 
          JavaScript Mapping</a> workshop, where students send return values straight to their html pages instead of using the console in between. Using 
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">catch</code> may even help with error checking.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Be less thorough:</strong> I realized that there are things I teach in this course that I, a person who spends hours a week writing JavaScript, never use.
        Namely, I never loop unless I am iterating over an array or something like that. Hence, why should I be teaching <code class="highlighter-rouge">while</code> 
        loops and friends? Modulo operator? Seriously? <strong>No Ninja Programming!</strong></p>

      <p>I had only one English major in my class and one first-year who was planning on becoming an English major. This was surprising, considering that the course was listed exclusively as an English course. This, of course, adds to my skepticism regarding how eager English majors are to take courses with a digital component—at least at NYU! Throughout my time at NYU, my self-designed courses have all fallen within the “Digital Literary Studies” rubric. Until this course, however, they fulfilled the English major’s “theory” requirement. I would typically have classes full of students saying that they chose the course because it was the least bad-looking course that fulfilled that requirement. I find it notable, then, that (given <em>n</em> = 3) though this was the most popular DLS course I taught, in terms of enrollment, it was also the least subscribed by majors in the home department. <a href="#fnref:english-major" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:underperformance">
      <p>Mind, it’s not like I ignored students. But this requires more than the standard courses of action related to emailing the students and their advisors. My students are not accustomed to this kind of work, so I can’t use the practices I learned in “regular” English courses in trying to mentor and monitor them. <a href="#fnref:underperformance" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
