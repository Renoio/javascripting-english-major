There’s a lot going on in just this one example, but, briefly, <code class="highlighter-rouge">console.log()</code>
is a way of using JavaScript to tell the console to output
something.<sup id="fnref:consolelog"><a href="#fn:consolelog" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Before we get too carried away with writing
JavaScript, however, I think it might be useful to learn a bit about
JavaScript’s history.</p>

<section id="hello-world">
  <h2 id="s-hello-world-hello-javascript">Hello, World! Hello, JavaScript!</h2>

  <p>I mentioned a few details about JavaScript’s history in the <a href="/v1/0-introduction/">FAQs</a>, but I’ll reiterate some of that now.</p>

  <p>Programming languages inherit from previous programming languages. The
writer(s) of a language will take parts they like from one language and mix it
with parts they like from another, and then add their own, new additions that
makes their language special. JavaScript is no different; in fact, JavaScript
might be especially good at revealing its mixed parentage. But that means,
concretely, that it helps to have a sense of the history of programming in
general when understanding why JavaScript looks like it does today.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3dvbkg">fourth episode of the BBC show <em>Connections</em> draws a
line</a> to computer programming that
begins with the Roman era <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbegal_aqueduct_and_mill">Barbegal aqueduct and
mill</a>. Sadly, James
Burke concludes his wry take on advances in technology with punch cards, but
he was also filming <em>Connections</em> in 1978. Nevertheless, Burke sees that the
key to how computers work is related to how they <em>organize information</em>.  How
to organize information is, not coincidentally, the first part of programming
that we will learn in this chapter.</p>

  <p>Speaking a few decades later, Douglas Crockford picks up the thread from where
Burke ended it (punchcards) and moves us all the way up to JavaScript in two
of his <em>Crockford on JavaScript</em> lectures, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JxAXlJEmNMg">The Early
Years</a>” and the first 20 minutes of
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY">And Then There Was
JavaScript</a>.” Although the
lectures are aimed at people with some programming knowledge, meaning that
they get pretty geeky, what Crockford does well is hammer home two key points
in the way computing has evolved over time:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The people who should be the first to recognize the value of an innovation
(like programmers) are often the last.</li>
    <li>Obsolete technologies fade away slowly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The implications of both points reveal why JavaScript has its quirks and why
those quirks are here to stay.</p>

  <p>The short version of Crockford’s history boils down to the fact that
JavaScript was written over ten days by one man, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan
Eich</a>. Netscape wanted a scripting
language for their web browser, Navigator, and Eich delivered. At the time,
Java was positioned to be “the language for the web,” as we would be running
Java applets on websites, so Netscape called Eich’s language “JavaScript,”
despite the fact that JavaScript inherited nearly nothing substantial from
Java.</p>

  <p>Once Microsoft put their <em>own</em> version of JavaScript in Internet Explorer, it
became clear that in order for JavaScript to be useful across the entire web,
it would have to be standardized. This took time, and, what’s more,
standardizing involved a process of maintaining compatibility. As a result,
JavaScript, as Crockford is fond to point out, has a lot of bad parts that are
here to stay. Nevertheless, he adds, it also has some <em>very good</em> parts. After
all, back in 2001 Crockford called JavaScript “<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html">the world’s most misunderstood
programming language</a>.” Yet
now programmers are focusing more on these good parts (it helps that Crockford
even wrote a book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">about JavaScript’s good
parts</a>), which is part of
what makes JavaScript so popular.</p>

  <p>As Crockford likes to point out, JavaScript is many things to many people,
allowing itself to be used in three different programming paradigms. It can be
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">procedural</a> language.
It can be used as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a> language.
Or it can be used as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>
language. Or all three in the same application. These are details that go
beyond the scope of this course, but they gesture towards the idea that
JavaScript is very flexible and very forgiving. This is part of why it’s so
easy to learn. But it’s also why it’s so easy for programmers to cause trouble
with it.<sup id="fnref:language-type"><a href="#fn:language-type" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>Now that we’ve got a bit of an introduction to the language’s history and
context out of the way, we can go back to the JavaScript console you learned
to open in the <a href="/v1/1-environment/">last chapter</a> and start
learning the language itself.</p>

</section>
<section id="data-types">
  <h2 id="s-basic-data-types">Basic data types</h2>

  <p>We hear the word “data” every day, but what, precisely, does it mean? If you
had to draw a picture of “data,” what would it look like? We can say “data is
information,” but doesn’t that just pass the buck, because now we have to ask
what “information” means?</p>

  <p>It maybe helps to remember that the word “data” is the plural version of the
Latin word “datum.” A datum is a single piece of information, abstract as that
sounds. It can be a number. It can be string of letters. It can be the answer
to the question “true or false?” It can also be the <em>lack</em> of information.</p>

  <p>Data can also be more complex. A datum can be a list or collection of other
pieces of data, or it can be a process that takes some data and generates new
data based on that data.</p>

  <p>These six possibilities (and more exist) make up the six most important <strong>data
types</strong> in JavaScript, namely <strong>number</strong>, <strong>string</strong>, <strong>boolean</strong>,
<strong>null</strong> / <strong>undefined</strong>, <strong>array</strong> / <strong>object</strong>, and <strong>function</strong>. We’ll only be working with
the first four types, the basic types, in this chapter.</p>

  <h3 id="s-number">Number</h3>

  <p>Numbers are precisely what they sound like—numbers. In JavaScript, it’s easy
to use numbers, because you just type them as numbers. Numbers can have
decimal points if they’re not integers. Try typing numbers into the console
and see what happens:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 9</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mf">1.5</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 1.5</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 9</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Your console may look a bit different in what it returns (including
<code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> after <code class="highlighter-rouge">console.log(9);</code>), but we can ignore that for now.</p>

  <p>But note also that I type a <code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code> at the end of every command. JavaScript is
not very picky with semicolons, but it’s better to include them as a matter of
habit. The semicolon comes at the end of a “statement,” which is a single
instruction given to the console. <code class="highlighter-rouge">9;</code> just means “the number 9.”
<code class="highlighter-rouge">console.log(9);</code> means “log the number 9 to the console.”</p>

  <h3 id="s-string">String</h3>

  <p>Strings are a bit trickier than numbers at first glance. They are any string
of characters enclosed by double quotes.<sup id="fnref:quoting"><a href="#fn:quoting" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Have you used a string
already in this course? Yes, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Hello, World!"</code> is a string containing the
characters <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hello, World!</code>. We can issue statements with strings in much the
same way we did with numbers:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "Hello, World!"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; Hello, World!</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"World, I just wanted to say </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">Hi!</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> 9 times!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "World, I just wanted to say \"Hi!\" 9 times!"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"World, I just wanted to say </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">Hi!</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> 9 times!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; World, I just wanted to say "Hi!" 9 times!</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Notice how strings can have double quotes inside of them, as long as you use a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\</code> (backslash) beforehand. What do you type if you want a backslash in the
string? Notice also that when we use <code class="highlighter-rouge">console.log()</code>, the result does not
have surrounding double quotes or the backslashes.</p>

  <h3 id="s-boolean">Boolean</h3>

  <p>A boolean is a value that is either <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>. They are named after
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>, an English
mathematician, and they are astonishingly useful in programming, because they
allow programs to make decisions based on values, much like you might make a
decision on where to get dinner based on a series of truth values. For
example, say you eat burritos every day for dinner except Fridays, when there is
a deal on falafel. You ask yourself the question, “Is today Friday?” If the
answer is “yes” (<code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>), then you go to the falafel joint. If the answer is
“no” (<code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>), you get a burrito.</p>

  <p>Since booleans are only ever true or false, you refer to them in JavaScript
using those two words:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; true</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; false</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; true</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; false</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> do <em>not</em> have double quotes around them. What
would happen if they did? I have also introduced you to <code class="highlighter-rouge">===</code> in this code
snippet. That is the “strict equal” <strong>comparison operator</strong>, and it is a way of
asking the console a question.<sup id="fnref:strictequal"><a href="#fn:strictequal" class="footnote">4</a></sup> <code class="highlighter-rouge">9 === 9;</code> is the same as “Is the number nine
the same thing as the number nine?” Because the answer is “yes,” the console
responds <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>. In the next example, we’re asking the question, “Is the number
nine the same thing as the string ‘Hello, World!’?” Since the answer is “no,”
the console responds <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>.</p>

  <p>Between numbers, strings, and booleans, we can start using JavaScript as a
calculator, but one type remains.</p>

  <h3 id="s-nullundefined">Null/Undefined</h3>

  <p>Sometimes we deal with a lack of information, instead of information we
understand as a datum. There are two main ways JavaScript understands that
lack, through an object called <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> and a data type called <code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code>.</p>

  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code> is an object that indicates the lack of information. Say you’re filling
out a questionnaire online and you left the last few questions unanswered but
still pressed “Submit.” The answered questions would be strings or numbers,
probably. But how should the computer understand the unanswered questions? The number zero doesn’t
seem right.  Nor does a blank string. In this case, it makes sense to register
that lack of answers with <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>.</p>

  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code>, on the other hand, is for information that we do not yet have.
Using the questionnaire example again, all of the answers are <code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code>
until you press “Submit” and send them to the computer, where it can then
decide what to do with them, by turning them into strings, numbers, or just
<code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>.</p>

  <p>The distinction is tricky, but now you’re definitely ready to start add up
some numbers in JavaScript.</p>

</section>
<section id="javascript-as-a-calculator">
  <h2 id="s-using-javascript-as-a-calculator">Using JavaScript as a calculator</h2>

  <p>You learned a comparison operator in the previous section, <code class="highlighter-rouge">===</code>, and you’ll
learn a few more in this section. You’ll also learn all five arithmetic
operators. In fact, let’s start with them:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 5</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; -1</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 6</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 0.6666666666666666</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>As you can see, the arithmetic operators give numbers as answers. The
comparison operators, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">===</code>, respond with <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <p>Programmers have figured out nifty ways to get around the difficulty of typing
≥ and ≤!</p>

  <p>Strings also have an operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code>. It comes in very handy in web development:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"I had a thought, but… "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"Oh yeah, I remember. Falafel on Fridays!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "I had a thought, but… Oh yeah, I remember. Falafel on Fridays!"</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>What happens when you add a string to a number? How about a number to a
string? Why?</p>

  <p>A JavaScript calculator doesn’t sound terribly interesting, so let’s add one
more wrinkle to it by introducing variables.</p>

</section>
<section id="calculator-understood-variables">
  <h2 id="s-what-if-the-calculator-understood-variables">What if the calculator understood variables?</h2>

  <p>Everything we have been doing above is fun for about three seconds. It is
interesting to test edge cases (what happens when you multiply a number with a
boolean?), of course, as that is a good way to understand the assumptions the
language is making. But we’re building websites, not calculators.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, getting a bit of flexibility with the console is useful. Let’s
expand on that, then, with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> statement, which lets us define
variables. Type along in the console.</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">burrito</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">burrito</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Basically the best food around."</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">burrito</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; Basically the best food around.</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>In the first line, you <strong>defined</strong> a variable, <code class="highlighter-rouge">burrito</code>. In the second, you
<strong>assigned</strong> to the variable the string, “Basically the best food around.”<sup id="fnref:let"><a href="#fn:let" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

  <p>Then you tell the console to log the variable burrito, and it logs its value,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Basically the best food around.</code></p>

  <p>Any of the data types you have learned about already you can assign to a
variable, and we can define multiple variables at once. It’s generally good
practice to define all your variables at the top, so you know what you will be
working with in the future.</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">magicNumber</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">magicNumber</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">magicNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 19</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">magicNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; false</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">magicNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; true</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">secretNumber</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 11</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">secretNumber</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 11</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>These variables persist only for the duration of the console. If you close the
console, then you’ll lose them. But the variables are also mutable,
as you can see. <code class="highlighter-rouge">secretNumber</code> starts out assigned to the number 10, but
then it becomes assigned to the number 11.</p>

  <p>Let’s play a bit more with assigning variables:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">tipRate</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">bill</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">billPlusTip</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">tipRate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.20</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">bill</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">10.00</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">billPlusTip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">bill</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">tipRate</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">bill</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">billPlusTip</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; 12</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">question</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">burritos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">question</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"What is the best food around?</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="s2">n"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">burritos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Delicious burritos"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">answer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">burritos</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">" are clearly the best!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">question</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; What is the best food around?</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; Delicious burritos are clearly the best!</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>There are two new things in this example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code> can be used to make a new line
to make a new line, and now you see that <code class="highlighter-rouge">console.log()</code> can take multiple
values in the parentheses, separated by commas.</p>

  <p>Finally, this discussion of variables allows me to introduce one more
operator, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">typeof</code> operator. If you get a variable, sometimes you don’t know
what kind of data type it is. Yet as we have seen with <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code>, it behaves
differently depending on the data. Continuing with the variables in the
previous example:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="nx">question</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "string"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="nx">magicNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "number"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "number"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">isItTrue</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nx">isItTrue</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="nx">isItTrue</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "boolean"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">typeof</span> <span class="nx">badTastingBurrito</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">//--&gt; "undefined"</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>As you can see, this example makes use of variables defined in earlier
exercises, but it also refers to variable that has not yet been assigned (or
even defined).</p>

<h2 id="s-footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:consolelog">
      <p>More precisely, <code class="highlighter-rouge">console</code> is a JavaScript object (similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">window</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">document</code>, as we’ll see later) that refers to the console you have opened in your browser. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.log()</code> is a “method” specific to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">console</code> object that outputs whatever is in sent as a parameter (or, inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code>).  In our example, we sent the console a snippet of text, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Hello, World!"</code>, and it returned it to us. <a href="#fnref:consolelog" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:language-type">
      <p>In this course, most of the JavaScript will be procedural, which encourages a step-by-step way of thinking through a solution. Once we move to making maps with Leaflet, the more object-oriented aspects will emerge. JavaScript’s functional personality is its most powerful and appealing, but it strikes me as the most difficult to understand and teach. <a href="#fnref:language-type" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:quoting">
      <p>Yes, JavaScript permits using single quotes as well, but you should use double quotes exclusively. <a href="#fnref:quoting" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:strictequal">
      <p>JavaScript has a less strict equality comparison operator, but its behavior can be unexpected. It is considered one of JavaScript’s bad parts, and I won’t be teaching it in this course. <a href="#fnref:strictequal" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:let">
      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> is a statement that is not supported in all JavaScript consoles. If typing the above causes the console to complain <code class="highlighter-rouge">Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier</code>, then you have one of those older consoles. The solution is, luckily, straightforward. For the duration of this course, where I instruct you to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">var</code>, instead. <a href="#fnref:let" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
