# The JavaScripting English Major

This repository hosts the course *The JavaScripting English Major*. It is
served (via GitHub pages) at
[http://the-javascripting-english-major.org/](http://the-javascripting-english-major.org/).

The course is divided into 15 sessions and is designed to teach humanities
undergraduates how to build a web project. More concretely, it teaches
students how to use:

* Git
* GitHub
* Atom
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Leaflet
* GeoJSON

It is largely based on Marijn Haverbekeâ€™s [*Eloquent
JavaScript*](http://eloquentjavascript.com), but it strips
out even parts of that wonderful book that are of limited value to students
eager to build simple projects, not understand a language deeply.

Its companion repository is @muziejus/javascripting-english-major-project,
which students fork and then change to meet their desires.
