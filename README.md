Today in class we learned how to use github in order to fork or clone work environments to have our own repository. We also learned how to link our github environment to our text editor which is in this case Atom. Along with linking Github to Atom, We learned how to briefly use atom in order to customize our experience that way we can better organize our work in a way that makes using the text editor easier. we then learned how to import our chosen github work environment into the atom work space so it saves on both ends as we work.

I feel like so far we were eased into the use of Atom as a text editor and how to link it to our github work spaces. I am confident in my basic understanding of what we are doing, and I am intrigued to know more about the complexities to using atom and Github.
