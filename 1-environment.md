# Setting up the Environment

It’s possible to start JavaScripting just by opening your browser, but for the
purposes of this course, we’re going to introduce two new pieces of software
that work to make your programming life easier.

This establishes a programming *environment*, which is a workflow in which
multiple pieces of software work together in order to make reaching your goals
as easy as possible. Many programming rely on IDEs, or integrated development
environments, such as Xcode for writing MacOS and iOS apps or R Studio for
writing in R. These are one-stop shops that try to handle the entirety of your
project within one piece of software. We’ll reach a similar state with Atom,
below, but not before first making a detour through Git.

A key concept to application development is “versioning.” That is, by making
use of a piece of software called a version control system, a project can work
as though it has a time machine attached to it. But not just a time machine.

Before moving forward, note that above I don’t refer to a “document” or even a
“file.” Most of the homework you’ve ever turned in before for an English class
has probably been a document, most likely written in Microsoft Word. In this
environment, we’re not creating one document or one file. Instead, we’re
working on one **project**, which is made up of many files, where each file
contributes its own bit to the project as a whole. A website (or a webapp) is
an example of a project—one that is made up, of course, of many documents. For
example, on even the most basic website, the information on the front page
could be saved in one file, and the information in the “About” page could be
saved in another. 

Thinking in terms of *projects*, not documents, is perhaps the first vital
leap for you to make. What we are building in this course is a website that is
a project. As such, you will have a folder for your project, and everything in
that folder will be under version control.

## Git

The version control system we will use in this course is called
“[Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).” Git is famously opaque, and, worse,
a novice user (like us) uses about three commands all the time except when
things go wrong. Luckily, when things go wrong, Git is often there to help us
out. Nevertheless, Git deserves its reputation that leads to websites like “[Oh
Shit, Git!](http://ohshitgit.com)”

Git calls a project a **repository**, so in the context of using Git, I’ll do
the same. A repository is a folder with files in it, like any regular folder
of files you have on your computer. However it also has, hidden from view, a
history of all the files in the folder. Git knows exactly when a file was
added. It knows every change ever made to each file. It even knows about files
that have been deleted, and it can resurrect them, if needed.

So far, this sounds like a backup system. And Git is *also* that. But it can
do much more. For example, every change you record with Git, called a
**commit**, also has a **commit message** attached to it, where you can leave
a note for yourself (or a collaborator!) that tells you what you were thinking
when you made a change. Why did you put this paragraph before that one? Read
your old commit messages.

Additionally, Git lets you **push** your changes to a central version of the
repository. This means that you can work on one computer, save your work,
commit it, push it, and then, on another computer, **pull** the changes and get
right back to work—with all that history still built in, even though you were
working *on another computer!*

That all of what we’ll be doing with Git in this course, and that is
already a lot. But as you can see, the system of committing, pushing, and
pulling means that collaboration becomes very easy. Additionally, Git allows
for **branching**, where you create new branches for your project. Now Git is
not only a time machine, but it’s also an interdimensional portal leading you
to alternate universes. In one universe, your text could be written full of
jokes. In another, it can be very serious.
