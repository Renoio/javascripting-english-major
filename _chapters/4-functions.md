chapter-no: 4
title: Functions
---

The [previous chapter](/3-programming) was very conceptual. Loops are tricky
to get a hang of, but once you visualize how looping can solve problems,
you‚Äôre definitely on your way to thinking algorithimically, which is to say,
programmatically. This chapter is a bit more focused, but it builds on the
idea of a **block** of code, like the loop or the if statement. Blocks in
JavaScript are always surrounded by braces (`{}`), and that is true for
**functions**, as well.

<section id="function-function">
## Function, function, what's your‚Ä¶

Just as looping is useful because it automates repetitive tasks, functions
break up your code into smaller pieces. This means that it‚Äôs easier to
reason about your work abstractly and find problems. Additionally, functions
also automate repetitive tasks, and that‚Äôs the way I‚Äôll introduce them to you.

Imagine if you want your computer to make burritos. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to
just tell it ‚Äúmake a burrito‚Äù every time you wanted one, instead of saying
‚Äúget out the tortillas, take one out, place it on the griddle,‚Äù and so on? We
make little tasks in our daily life abstract using the huge figurative power
of language as well as our own memories. Computers can‚Äôt think as abstractly,
however. And though they do have memories, we still need to spell things out
in detail. Yet once we do it, we‚Äôre set. We can ask the computer to make us a
burrito from then on.

Of course, I don‚Äôt think computers can make good burritos, but stick with me.

All those burrito-making instructions can be collapsed into a function. That
might look something like:

```javascript
// This code is for illustration only. It will crash your console.
//
let makeABurrito;
makeABurrito = function(){
  prepareTortilla();
  addBeans();
  addOnionsAndCilantro();
  // etc.
  rollUpTortilla();
}
```

As you can see, there are syntactic similarities between functions and loops.
Both use blocks with braces, and both have parentheses. In fact, this snippet
of code is perfectly fine JavaScript. That‚Äôs because the `makeABurrito()`
function does nothing but **call** other functions. We can imagine that a
function like `prepareTortilla()` has even more specific steps inside it. But
with the function in place, you just have to execute `makeABurrito()` once and
be done with it. The internals of the function take care of everything else.

Quickly before moving on, that line `// etc.` is a **comment**. Comments are
very useful in programming because they can serve as little messages to
yourself (or to other programmers) about what is going on in your program.
In JavaScript, everything after two slashes (`//`) to the end of the line is
**commented out**. If you want to comment out a whole section of multiple lines, begin
it with `/*` and close it with `*/`. Or you can put a `//` in front of every
line. I‚Äôll start commenting the code I provide, where necessary.

<section id="parameters">
## Parameters

Back to the function. Did you notice the parentheses that follow the function
name? Where have you seen this kind of of syntax before? We‚Äôve already gone
over `prompt()`, for example, in the [previous chapter](/3-programming/), and
that is, of course, a function.[^console] But recall how we typed it:

```javascript
let userInput;
userInput = prompt("What do you want to have for dinner?", "Type your answer here.");
```

The parentheses aren‚Äôt empty. Instead, they have two strings in them. From
experience, we know that that the first string is what appears at the top of
the prompt box, and the second string is what appears where we type our
answer. We can abstract out the function, then, as `prompt(promptText,
defaultText)`, where `promptText` and `defaultText` are two variables. And, in
fact, if we were to rewrite the above as:


```javascript
let promptText, defaultText, userInput;
promptText = "What do you want to have for dinner?";
defaultText = "Type your answer here.";
userInput = prompt(promptText, defaultText);
```

It would work in exactly the same way. These two variables, `promptText` and
`defaultText` are **parameters** that we **send** to the function.[^arguments] Giving
functions parameters lets us change the internals of the function to let it
react to specific instances. Now sometimes I want black beans in my burrito,
and sometimes I want pinto beans. Let‚Äôs add a parameter to `makeABurrito()` to
let us specify which beans to use on the fly:

```javascript
// This code is for illustration only. It will crash your console.
//
let makeABurrito;
makeABurrito = function(beansVariable){
  let beansResponse;
  prepareTortilla();
  addBeans();
  addOnionsAndCilantro();
  beansResponse = "You ordered " + beansVariable + " beans. Good choice!";
  $("#response").html(beansResponse);
  // etc.
  rollUpTortilla();
}
```

If we were to execute:

```javascript
// This code is for illustration only. It will crash your console.
//
let blackBeans;
blackBeans = "black";
makeABurrito(blackBeans);
```

We would see that the webpage would now read ‚ÄúYou ordered black beans. Good
choice!‚Äù Don‚Äôt actually try this, yet, though. Can you see why that is the
case? We define a variable, `blackBeans` and assign it to the string `"black"`.
Next, we send (or **pass**) that variable as a parameter to `makeABurrito()`.
Now, inside the function, we see that it makes reference to a `beansVariable`,
that has the value ‚Äúblack,‚Äù which it then prints in `#response`, like we did last
chapter.

But where did `beansVariable` come from? And how did it get set to ‚Äúblack‚Äù?
There‚Äôs no `beansVariable = "black"`, after all. The answer is that the
variable is defined at the same time as the function is. `makeABurrito =
function(beansVariable){}` defines both the function, `makeABurrito()`, and
the parameter, `beansVariable`, which can be used as a variable inside the
function.

The number of parameters you can define is up to you. Imagine you had
different kinds of tortillas, like whole wheat and regular wheat. You can
redefine the function as:

```javascript
// This code is for illustration only. It will crash your console.
//
let makeABurrito;
makeABurrito = function(beansVariable, tortillaVariable){
  prepareTortilla(tortillaVariable);
  addBeans(beansVariable);
  addOnionsAndCilantro();
  // etc.
  rollUpTortilla();
}
```

What would happen if you executed `makeABurrito("black", "whole wheat")`?
Notice how this looks rather similar to `prompt(promptText, defaultText);`?

<section id="back-to-numbers">
## Back to numbers

`makeABurrito()` is a great function, and it‚Äôs making me hungry, so let‚Äôs
abandon it for a bit and go back to using numbers. Back in [Chapter
2](/2-calculator), we made a tipping calculator. We can build on that example
  with real, usable code.

First, what information do you need in order to know how much to tip? You need
to know the `total` and the `tipRate`, which is a percentage, like 15 or 20%.
The barebones function looks like this, then:

```javascript
let tipCalculator;
tipCalculator = function(total, tipRate){
  // 1. Calculate the percentage of the total 
  // as a variable ‚ÄútipAmount‚Äù
  //
  // 2. Change #response to tell us the tip
  // amount.
} 
```

In fact, type this into your `scripts.js` file. It can go after the earlier
code you‚Äôve written, or it can replace it. Note what‚Äôs in the comments; it‚Äôs a
sketch of what the function will do. The first step is that it‚Äôll do some
math‚Äîan easy calculation. In the second step, it will tell us what the result
of the calculation is.

```javascript
let tipCalculator;
tipCalculator = function(total, tipRate){
  // step 1:
  let tipAmount;
  tipAmount = tipRate * total;
  // and step 2:
  $("#response").html("Your tip is $" + tipAmount);
}; 

// Now call (or ‚Äúexecute‚Äù) the function, passing a 
// total of $50.00 and a tipRate of 20%:

tipCalculator(50.00, 0.2);
```

Save and reload, and the webpage should now inform you that you owe $10. If it
does, commit. In the exercises, we‚Äôll expand on this function.

</section>
<section id="scope">
## Scope

Alongside the idea of a function block, that is, the set of curly braces, we
also have the idea of **scope**. Beginner programmers often get tripped up by
scope, but that‚Äôs ok, so do veteran programmers. Note that though conditionals
and loops also use blocks, they don‚Äôt affect scope in the same way.

Just like a ‚Äúscope‚Äù is used to see things that are far away (tele*scope*) or
are really tiny (micro*scope*), in JavaScript, scope also has to do with
visbility. Variables defined with the `let` keyword have block-level
scope.[^var-let] That means:

```javascript
> let global;
> global = "üåè";
> if (true) { console.log(global); };
//--> üåè
> let globalFunction;
> globalFunction = function(){ console.log(global); };
> globalFunction();
//--> üåè
```

When we define `global`, it‚Äôs *visible* to us inside subsequent if statements
and functions. But notice this:

```javascript
> let global;
> global = "üåè";
> if (true) {
    let blocky;
    blocky = "üìì";
    console.log("global is " + global);
    console.log("blocky is " + blocky);
  }
//--> global is üåè
//--> blocky is üìì
> console.log("Wait, the value of blocky is really " + blocky + "?");
```

This last line will crash with a `ReferenceError`. `blocky`, it turns out, is
only visible *within* the if statement block. Once the code leaves the `{}`,
`blocky` is no longer available. The same works with functions:

```javascript
> let global;
> global = "üåè";
> let showMeABurrito = function(){
    let burrito;
    burrito = "üåØ"; 
    global = "I‚Äôm global!";
    console.log("global is " + global);
    console.log("burrito is " + burrito);
  }
> showMeABurrito();
//--> global is I‚Äôm global!
//--> burrito is üåØ
> console.log(global);
//--> I‚Äôm global!
> console.log("Wait, the value of burrito is really " + burrito + "?");
```

Crash. Again. Sadly, `burrito is not defined`. But notice that `global` was
changed inside the function, and that change persisted outside the
function. `global` is visible‚Äîand, as a result, changeable (or
**mutable**)‚Äîeverywhere. But `burrito` is not.

As Molly Bloom asks, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs he when he‚Äôs at home?‚Äù and we may, also, ask,
‚Äúwhere are we when we‚Äôre in the console?‚Äù That is, if `burrito` is defined in
the function block, where on earth is `global` defined? Even though we talk
about typing ‚Äúin‚Äù the console, we‚Äôre actually always within a special object
called `window`. It is the [window of the
browser](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_window.asp), and when we open up
the console, we‚Äôre getting closer access to that window. In fact, `prompt()`
and `alert()`, two functions you‚Äôve already seen, are actually **methods** that
belong to `window`; `window.alert()` and `alert()` will do the same thing. But
more on methods [next chapter](/5-collections). The `window` is typically
ignored, as it‚Äôs the frame that is unavoidable. Its ubiquity gives it the
privilege of being silent.

Back to the purpose of this section. Scope helps you keep your code tidy,
because there is less risk of variables‚Äô being accessed where they shouldn‚Äôt
be. Just remember, whenever you type `let` to define a variable inside a
function, that variable is only available inside that function.

In closing, functions are powerful things, as we can see. And though,
ultimately, the goals of this course are not to write code that is as modular
as the use of functions would make possible, you will still be typing the word
`function` a lot.

1. Add functionality to the tip calculator so that you can enter ‚Äú20‚Äù *or*
   ‚Äú.2‚Äù for 20%, and the calculator understands the difference.

## Footnotes

[^console]: `console.log()` also looks like a function, but as I mentioned back in [chapter 2](2-calculator/#fn:consolelog), `.log()` is a method belonging to the `console` object. 

[^arguments]: Parameters are also often called **arguments**, but to my ears, that term is more opaque.

[^var-let]: This is one difference between `var` and `let`, but I‚Äôm not teaching `var` except for those of you with old browsers. Other than the slightly contrived examples in this section, my examples won‚Äôt be making a lot of use of block-scoping.
