*The JavaScripting English Major* is created by [Moacir P. de Sá
Pereira](http://moacir.com) to be used, initially, in the 2017 course “[Novel
Maps of New York](https://muziejus.github.io/novel-maps-of-ny-2017/),” taught
as part of the Digital Literary Studies sequence in the [English Department at
NYU](http://english.fas.nyu.edu).

This course owes its greatest debt to Marijn Haverbeke’s book [*Eloquent
JavaScript*](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), which is available both online
for free and in an elegant paperback. The title is a nod to [*The Programming
Historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/). The scope here is much
smaller, of course, but I have tried to use that site as a model.

More information about the project in general is available in the [zeroth
chapter](/0-introduction/).

The website is created using {% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), and it is hosted on GitHub Pages.
